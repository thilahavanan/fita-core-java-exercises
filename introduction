Control Statements

1. Whats is the output of the below code
   public void conditionalStatement() {   
      int number = 0;
      if (number > 0) {
         System.out.println("Number is positive.");
      }
      else if (number < 0) {
         System.out.println("Number is negative.");
      }
      else {
         System.out.println("Number is 0.");
      } 
   }
   
2.Whats is the output of the below code 
   a.if you change value of number from 99 to -8
   b.if you change value from 99 to 1
   c.if you change value from 99 to 0
   d.if you change value from 99 to -99

public void conditionalStatement() {   
      int number = 99;
      if (number > 0 && number<50) {
         System.out.println("Number is positive and between 50");
      }
      else if (number < 0 || number>-10) {
         System.out.println("Number is negative and between -10");
      }
      else {
         System.out.println("Number is 0.");
      } 
   }
3. Write a method with below criteria
   a.return a String 
   b.Accept the parameters as String value
   c.While calling this method, it should return the value I passed into the arguments/parameters.
   
4.Write a method with below criteria
   a.Create two method with Similar method name
   b.method one will accept two int value as argumets/parameters
   c.method two will accept two String value as arguments/parameters
   d.Inside method just prin the value that we are passing into the method
   e.both method does not return anything.
   
5. What is the output of the following code
   for(int k=10;k<100;k=k+10)
   {
      System.out.println(k);
   }

6.Will the below code print as "FITA Tambaram" ?
   int i=0;
   while(i<0){
      System.out.println("FITA Tambaram");
   }
   
7.what is the ouput of below code if below conditions are applied
   a.i is -1000
   b.i is 1000
   c.i is 10000
   d.i is -1
   e.i is 999
   
   do{
      if(i<1001)
      {
         System.out.println("i is less than 1001");
      }
      else if(i>1000){
         System.out.println("i is Gretter than 1000");
      }
      else if(i<0){
         System.out.println("i is Negative value")
      }
      else{
         System.out.println("i is in Else")
      }   
      }while(i<1000)
      
 8. Declare a static variable as String type
 9. Declare a boolean value with default value as true
 10.Declare a
